//! Zero-knowledge proof support using STWO and Cairo
//!
//! This module provides zk-SNARK functionality for:
//! - Proof compression (aggregate many HexaryProofs into one STARK proof)
//! - Confidential queries (prove query results without revealing data)
//! - L2 rollup (off-chain execution with on-chain verification)
//!
//! # Feature Flag
//!
//! This module requires the `zk` feature to be enabled:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! stoolap = { version = "0.3", features = ["zk"] }
//! ```
//!
//! # STWO Integration
//!
//! STWO (Stwo prover) is a Circle STARK prover/verifier written in Rust.
//! It enables efficient proof generation and verification for Cairo programs.

#[cfg(feature = "zk")]
pub mod prover;

#[cfg(feature = "zk")]
pub use prover::{ProverConfig, STWOProver};
